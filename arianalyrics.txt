Step up the two of us, nobody knows us/
Get in the car like, "Skrrt"/
Stayin' up all night, order me pad thai/
Then we gon' sleep 'til noon/
Me with no makeup, you in the bathtub/
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh/
This is a pleasure, feel like we never/
Act this regular/
Click, click, click and post/
Drip-drip-dripped in gold/
Quick, quick, quick, let's go/
Kiss me and take off your clothes/
Imagine a world like that/
Imagine a world like that/
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest/
Love how my face fits so good in your neck/
Why can't you imagine a world like that?/
Imagine a world/
Knew you were perfect after the first kiss/
Took a deep breath like, "Ooh"/
Feels like forever, baby, I never/
Thought that it would be you/
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit/
That's how I know it's true/
Baby, direct it, name in the credits/
Like the movies do/
Click, click, click and post/
Drip-drip-dripped in gold/
Quick, quick, quick, let's go/
Kiss me and take off your clothes/
Imagine a world like that/
Imagine a world like that/
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest/
Love how my face fits so good in your neck/
Why can't you imagine a world like that?/
Imagine a world/
Can you imagine it?/
Can you imagine it?/
Can you imagine it?/
Can you imagine it?/
Can you imagine it? (Can you imagine?)/
Can you imagine it? (Can you imagine?)/
Can you imagine it? Ooh/
Imagine that (can you imagine?)/
Imagine it, imagine it/
Imagine it, imagine it/
Imagine/
Imagine/
Imagine/
Imagine/
Imagine/
Imagine/
If you take too long to hit me back/
I can't promise you how I'll react/
But all I can say/
Is at least I'll wait for you/

Lately I've been on a roller coaster/
Tryna get a hold of my emotions/
But all that I know/
Is I need you close/

And I'ma scream and shout for what I love/
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks/
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up/
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up/

I'm obsessive and I love too hard/
Good at overthinking with my heart/
How you even think it got this far?/
This far/

And I can be needy, way too damn needy/
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed/
I can be needy, so hard to please me/
I know it feels so good to be needed/

Sorry if I'm up and down a lot/
Sorry that I think I'm not enough/
And sorry if I say "sorry" way too much/

You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)/
But after all this damage I can't help it (Help it)/
Or what you can trust, 'cause I need your touch/

I'ma scream and shout for what I love/
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks/
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up/
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up/

I'm obsessive and I love too hard/
Good at overthinking with my heart/
How you even think it got this far?/
This far/

And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed
This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don't wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain't no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time

Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A

Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)

I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Because I'm trying to do the best I can. And they can't find something to satisfy me. Look.

Even though you're bad for me, I know
You're the one that I'm thinkin'
Got me feeling so incredible
Would you mind maybe linking?

Love me, love me, baby
Are you down? Can you let me know?
Love me, thank you, leave me
Put it down, then it's time to go
Get it like you love me
But you don't, boy, it's just for show
Take it or leave it, you gotta take it or leave it like uh-uh

Don't want you in my bloodline (yuh)
Just wanna have a good time (yuh)
Ain't no need to apologise, no
But you gon' have to let this shit go

Not tryna make you all mine (yuh)
Ain't no need to apologise, no
But you gon' have to let this shit go, yeah

No, we won't be talking the next day
I ain't got nothin' to say
I ain't looking for my one true love
Yeah, that ship sailed away

Love me, love me, baby
Are you down? Can you let me know?
Love me, thank you, leave me
Put it down, then it's time to go
Get it like you love me
But you don't, boy, it's just for show
Take it or leave it, you gotta take it or leave it like uh-uh

Don't want you in my bloodline (yuh)

Not tryna make you all mine 
(Not tryna make you)
Ain't no need to apologise 
(Ain't no need to—)
But you gon' have to let this shit go, yeah

Say I know what you want, what you want from me
I know what you think, what you think you see
(So what you think?)
I know what you're looking for, but I'm complete
I know what you need, but it won't be me

I know what you want, what you want from me
I know what you think, what you think you see
I know what you're looking for, but I'm complete
I know what you need, but it won't be me
But it won't be me

Don't want you in my bloodline

Don't want you in my bloodline (yuh)
Not tryna make you all mine (yuh)
Ain't no need to apologise (no)
But you gon' have to let this shit go, yeah
I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleepin' next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)

Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Heavy tears, a rain parade from hell (From hell)

Baby, you do it so well
You been so understanding, you been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself, 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mm
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

We'll get through this
We'll get past this
I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you
We'll get past this
I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh, yeah

Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)

And after all that we been through
(And after all that we been through)
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)

Baby, you do it so well
You been so understanding, you been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself, 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you, baby

I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mm
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

We'll get through this
We'll get past this

A whole lot of baggage
But I love you (But I love you)
We'll get past this (Past this)
I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh, yeah
After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears

Another night, another party
Sayin' "Hi" to everybody
I'm sorry
I start to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now
I'm starving

Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I'm not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love
And all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Ooh, ah (Ooh, ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Ooh, ah (Ooh, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin' on the TV
It's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it's shocking
Don't blame me

I know it's the life that I chose
But, baby, I'm grateful. I want you to know
I'm happy for the love
And all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

Here's the thing: you're in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only thing you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away. I'm coming over.
Painted a picture; I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart; I said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel, angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought that you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrt, skrt)

Yeah, look at you, boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (for the heart, for the heart)
I figure we can work it out, hmm

Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart; said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel, Abel, Abel, Abel, Abel
I know you're able, willing and able

Falling, falling, but I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought that you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrt, skrt)

Yeah, look at you, boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (for the heart, for the heart)
I figure we can work it out, hmm

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren't
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Yeah, yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can't hold that shit against you, ah
Yes, I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

Thought you were somebody else, you (You)
Thought you were somebody else, you
Yeah
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things

Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with cuffs and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing

My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossin'
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'

You like my hair?

Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all 'em."
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms"

My smile is beamin'
My skin is gleamin'
The way it shine
I know you've seen it
You've seen it

I bought a crib

Gee, thanks! Just bought it
Oh, yeah

Yep

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black Card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me

I don't mean to brag
But I be like, "Put it in the bag."
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah

Shoot
Go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop
Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot

Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get
Yeah

I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Oh, yeah, yeah

You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it

Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love

Took one fuckin' look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

Then I realize she's right there
